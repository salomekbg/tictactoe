# tic-tac-toe

###### This web app uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript for a simple two-player version of tic-tac-toe.

1. Go to the site: https://salomekbg.github.io/tictactoe/.
2. Player 1 (X) will **always** go first.  Click on any one of the black squares to place your "X" token.
3.  The next token will automatically be an "O" token and can be placed on any of the remaining squares.
  1. *An alert will pop up if you try to place your token on any square that already has a token in it.*
4.  Continue placing tokens until one player has three of the same tokens in a row.
5.  Once a winner has been determined, the web app will show the winner below the grid and will show the winning combination, by highlighting it in green.
6.  If you would like to play a new game, click the "New Game" button right above the grid.
